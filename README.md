I am currently an undergraduate Year 4 student at City University of Hong Kong who is interested in computer-graphic-related topics, like 3D reconstruction, digital human (with computer vision), etc. You can try to have a look at my personal website (in Chinese) (The functions in the website is not so completed, and I will improve them in these days).

Currently some projects are processing and they may be public once determined.
